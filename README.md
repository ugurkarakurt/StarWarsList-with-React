# Star Wars List with React (with swapi.dev & json-server)

Contact list created with a **Fake REST API**

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Swapi](https://swapi.dev/).
- [JSONPlaceholder - Live running version](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

# Getting started

Install Packages

```
npm install
```

After the installations are successful, we need to run Json-server

```
json-server --watch api/db.json // Since it runs on" json server and react" 3000 port, we need to start json server first.
```

###### Now we are ready to start the project

```
npm run start // Since the port is full, we should say "yes" to the question it will ask to open on port 3001.
```
